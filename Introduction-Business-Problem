<h2>Introduction/Business Problem</h2>

The city council of the town of Lancaster, Pennsylvania is looking to increase the "walkability" of their downtown area, or the number of locations downtown that will draw the attention of visitors who are in the downtown area.

The goal of the city council by running this data project is to determine what business gaps there are within the town, in hopes of spurring those looking to start a small business towards those types of establishments.

To accomplish this, their project will require that the current establishments within the city be examined for correlations with other business types, and this data be used to create a list of their top 50 business gaps.
