Data

To create the list of the top 10 business gaps in the city, we will be utilizing two sources of data: Business location data and category types from the FourSquare API, and a spreadsheet determining which categories are considered "walkable".

Using these data sources we will find which business types that are "walkable" are most commonly found near each other, and then use that information to provide a list of which businesses are missing there correlated counterparts.
